# Lunte Linter Development Plan

## Stage 0 ‚Äì Project Scaffold ‚úÖ (complete)

- CLI entry wired via `package.json`, Acorn vendored under `vendor/acorn`, and the repository structured as a plain JavaScript project with `node:test`.
- Shared layout for core utilities (`src/core`), rules (`src/rules`), and docs is in place.

## Stage 1 ‚Äì Minimal Analyzer ‚úÖ (complete)

- File resolution, CLI argument parsing (including glob support), AST parsing, scope tracking, and the base reporter are shipped.
- Initial rule engine and the first rules (`no-use-before-define`, `no-undef`, `no-unused-vars`) are active.

## Stage 2 ‚Äì Configuration & Reporting ‚öôÔ∏è (in progress)

- DONE: `.lunterc` / `.lunterc.json` loading with CLI merge, gitignore-style `.lunteignore`, default env/globals, improved console formatting, and inline disable directives (`lunte-disable-line`, `lunte-disable-next-line`).
- TODO: per-rule options surfaced via config, additional reporters (stylish/JSON/SARIF), quiet mode, and documentation of config keys.

## Stage 3 ‚Äì Rule Suite Expansion ‚öôÔ∏è (in progress)

- DONE: Core helpers now recognise exports, module-level hoisting, DOM globals, and destructuring.
- TODO: add more semantic rules (shadowing, unused params, constant folding), begin autofix infrastructure, expand fixture coverage.

## Stage 4 ‚Äì Incremental & Integration Prep üõ£Ô∏è (not started)

- Introduce an analysis cache / `--watch` mode.
- Publish a small programmatic API with typings/JSDoc and author contributor docs.
- Design LSP-ready service interfaces (diagnostics, code actions).

## Stage 5 ‚Äì LSP Prototype üß≠ (not started)

- Build the lightweight LSP server on top of the shared analyzer.
- Emit proper LSP diagnostics and quick-fix actions; test with VS Code / Neovim adapters.
- Document editor integration in `docs/integration.md`.

## Near-Term Next Steps

- Finish Stage‚ÄØ2 deliverables (reporters + config docs).
- Add rule options/overrides documentation and expose severity toggles via config.
- Plan incremental analysis work (API sketch + cache semantics).
